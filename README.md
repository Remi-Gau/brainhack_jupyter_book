> Everything Brainhack: past, present and future

[Brainhack](https://brainhack.org) refers to a series of community events, that bring
together scientists from all around the world with a variety of expertise and
disciplines to facilitate neuroscience research for the community by creating
tools, methodologies, techniques, ideas, and guidelines.

Together with this book, we aim to create a freely and openly accessible source
for the community, that gives a general overview about the aims, tools,
and the outputs of the Brainhack events, that is open to the community's
contributions. This book is also created by the Brainhack community as a
supplement to the [Neuron, 2020 community paper](https://psyarxiv.com/rytjq/)

## Goals of the Book :dart:

This Brainhack Book aims to;

- create an open, freely accessible central source for about the concept of the
  Brainhack events.
- provide a projection about the past and future of the Brainhack events.
- showcase an overview of the scope and outputs of the events run all around the
  world to this day.
- curate a glossary about the Brainhack community terms.
- give interactive graphical and media content about the events.
- create a living and growing community source with the contributions from the
  any member of the community.
